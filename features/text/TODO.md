# @lambda-ui/text

Components for rendering text. It can be used to render an abstract
representation of a Markdown document or other text-based content.

## Future ideas

- Link
  - Show status of links via icon and color. For example, visited links have a
    gray icon, new links have a blue icon, internal links have an arrow icon,
    and broken links are red with a broken link icon. Visited links could
    further track the number of times they were visited.
  - Popover for link icons that shows statistics and preview for the linked
    content.
