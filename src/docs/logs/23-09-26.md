# Layered Architecture

The current kernel is monolithic and thus difficult to grasp and adapt.

- :^icons/thumbs-up: Every asset can be fetched lazily. The kernel ensures that
  all requests hit the caching layer, even if they are concurrent.
- :^icons/thumbs-down: It is difficult to mock parts of the kernel, as they are
  global functions that call each other.
- :^icons/thumbs-down: Dependencies between parts are not transparent. For
  example, it is not clear which generation step request which assets.

It might be possible to split the kernel into layers. Each layer exposes a
simple interface that a higher-level layer implementation can use. For example,
the SWC layer only needs the file versions. There could be two implementations
for the template layer, one that uses SWC in the background, and one that only
generates from files directly.

- Memory layers
  - Texts
    - updates on modified file
    - can be initialized with in-memory files
  - Checksums
    - updates on modified file
  - Manifests
    - sync manifest retrieval
    - discovery of linked manifests
    - merging of discovered manifests

- Physical Layers
  - Swc
    - loads binary from configurable URL
    - handles decompression of SWC parser
  - Programs
  - Templates
  - Roots
    - parses a template to get a root
  - Pages
    - parses a root for derived data
  - Graphs
    - physical cache map

- Cache types
  - Cache Map
  - Binary Cache

- Storage
  - indexed DB
  - file system
  - concurrent
  - sync / async
