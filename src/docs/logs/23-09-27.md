# Architecture Thoughts

Split into layers:

- discovery
  - collect manifests from an entry point
  - find files in a directory
  - convert repo content to manifests and save to typescript
- compiler: can generate assets async
  - assumes modules are loaded async as well (allows dynamic import)
  - cache options: file system, IndexedDB, memory
  - can be used server-side and client-side (with correct cache info)
- bundler: uses compiler to generate serializable asset collections
  - generate data for client-side hydration
  - use router to hide asset filenames behind public paths
  - allows building whole repos by generating all assets
  - bundles are degenerate, they can always be merged into one
- router: maps incoming paths to asset filenames
  - can be applied to a bundler or to a compiler
  - could be extended to URLs or whole Request objects
- server: serves bundles
  - can use compiler as storage for development
  - can use cache-only (no generation) in production context
- client: async access to remote (or locally cached) bundle
  - can use compiler as storage for development
  - can use cache-only (no generation) in production context
- reader: provides sync access to a bundle and imported module
  - cannot be used to compile or bundle documents
  - provides manifests, values, and contents of a bundle
  - optimized for integrating into preact (without suspense)

## Tasks

- compiler
  - [ ] define input/output interface
  - [ ] finish whole pipeline
