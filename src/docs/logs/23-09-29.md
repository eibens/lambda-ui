# Litdoc Library (public API)

- Cache
  - utilities for storage and caching
  - only place where environment specific code lives
  - Loader
    - read only storage
  - Storage
    - read and write storage
  - Result
    - sync results of async loaders

- Lit
  - extremely light-weight, no non-type dependencies allowed
  - lit function for writing literate code
  - all types involved in the lit function
  - includes types for the Litdoc Editor tree?
    - should have compatibility with `mdast` at some point

- Tokens
  - implementation of the token extension for markdown

- Weaver
  - depends on: type Lit
  - generate Markdown templates from TypeScript modules
  - process template literals
  - replace runtime values with tokens
  - optionally use TypeScript AST for interweaving TypeScript code
  - discovers and links modules starting from an entry point
  - does not no about Markdown
    - no insertion of links
    - can only generate tokens

- Parser
  - depends on: parsing libraries, WASM modules
  - manages parsers for external languages
  - Swc
    - parser for TypeScript
    - loaded from WASM file
  - Markdown
    - parser for Litdoc Markdown
    - extension for token parsing (needed for LitDoc)

- Reader
  - depends on: slate, slate-react
  - read only (no in-template resolution of values)
    - e.g. link lists, TOC, children, must already be in-lined
  - tokens must already be assigned to the nodes
  - creates a slate editor for LitDoc

- Editor
  - depends on: Reader
  - recursive resolution of value tokens for runtime template generation
    - easiest to do with slate due to recursive normalization
  - runtime parsing of
  - types for Litdoc Markdown AST
  - helpers for extracting data from the AST
  - resolution of tokens in the editor (replacement with AST nodes)

- Bundler
  - depends on: Lit, Weaver, Parser, Editor
    - preact, slate, slate-preact-proxy
  - virtual file system as sources
  - caching for generating artifacts
  - generates manifest modules
  - generates static assets for production
    - compilation artifacts
    - HTML for static sites
    - bakes server-side bundles into HTML for hydration
    - generates script bundles
    - islands implementation?

- Router
  - depends on: path manipulation if needed
  - maps Requests to modules and other assets
  - plugin system to add automatic routes
    - for example, source mode exposes source code of all assets
  - reverse lookup of routes
    - for generation of manifests
    - automatic routing based on file-system
  - manual routing with user-supplied mappings

- Server
  - depends on: Router, Cache
  - http endpoints for use with Client
  - dark mode (server-side)
  - Production
    - production server that serves builder output
  - Development
    - depends on: Bundler
    - automatic invalidation of changed files
    - debugging and error handling for development

- Client
  - depends on: Router, Reader
  - handles fetching of
  - client-side caching (optional)
  - dark mode (client-side)
  - default Litdoc template
  - configure with custom components, colors, icons, etc.

- Dev
  - depends on: Router, Server, Client, Bundler
  - can host development server in service worker
  - playground client for interacting with the server
  - virtual file-system on client
