# Clients, bundlers, and caching

Litdoc needs to run in a variety of contexts with different backing stores.

- The development server uses the local filesystem for reading files and caching
  generated assets.
- The browser playground uses IndexedDB for caching generated assets.
- The cloud client uses remote storage via HTTP server.
- The cloud server uses a Mysql database connection for storing caching
  generated assets.

How can I achieve this:

- Various backing stores with different updating logic.
- Optional in-memory caching for all contexts.
- Persistent client-side caching with cloud sync.
- Persistent server-side caching in file system or database.
- Running in service worker.
- Bundler should only be hit when necessary.

> - Assumption: There is only one version of the bundler, which means that
  > checksums always yield the same result, no matter the context. This allows
  > implementations to look up data anywhere. To get rid of this assumption,
  > include a bundler version.
> - Assumption: Invoking the doc function of a Litdoc module always yields the
  > same general result.

- Client: Memory > IndexedDB > HTTP
- Server: HTTP > Memory > Filesystem
- Cloud: HTTP > Memory > Database

# Content

- text
  - file
  - data
  - checksum

- template (file)
  - program
    - swc
    - text
  - template.stringifyProgram
    - text
    - program
    - manifest

- template-lite (file)
  - template.stringifyCalls
    - manifest

- bundle (path)
  - root
    - template
    -
  - pages

```ts
type Swc = {
  swc: {
    get: (): Promise<Uint8Array>
    set: (output: Uint8Array): Promise<void>
  }
}
```

# Viewer

- Static: Get the root of the current page and all linked pages. This bundle is
  baked into the server-side rendered HTML. For example, in Fresh one can simply
  pass the bundle to the island.
- Async: Fetch the roots and linked pages of the linked pages. This happens
  async and anticipates the user clicking or hovering a link for preview.
- Async: Fetch site index data, which includes all reachable pages.
- Async: When the user clicks a link, fetch the root (if it is not already being
  fetched).

Each of these requests returns a bundle, that is merged into the client storage.
This means the in-memory cache is updated, as well as the IndexedDB cache.

# Bundler

```ts
type Viewer = {
  getRoot: (file: string)
}
```

# Router

Separate entity that maps URLs and paths to files. For now, Litdoc will only
support file-system based routing. This means that the structure of the files
and folders defines the structure of the website.

# Pure Markdown Mode

Markdown (and other non script assets) do not have exports. The markdown source
is already a valid template, so there is no need to pass it to the template
module at all.

# No-typescript Mode

TypeScript source code is only needed if the document is for literate
programming. In other cases, the template can be generated from the module
exports alone.

The user can enable no-typescript mode with the `.doc.ts` or `.doc.tsx`
extension. This will cause the bundler to skip the TypeScript compiler and only
use the exports.

# Todo

- kernel
  - single entry point (one litdoc module)
  - no-typescript mode (no AST generation and transmission)
  - private mode (no source, AST, or template access)
  - pure markdown mode
  - read only mode (no writing to persistent cache)
- router
  - server and client side routing
  - hide raw file names from client
  - routing based on pattern matching URLs
  - use route data in document
- client
  - fetching of bundles (index and linked)
  - merging of bundles (from static and async endpoint)
  - in-memory caching
  - indexedDB caching
  - in-browser bundling
- server
  - mysql sources
  - mysql caching
  - bundle HTTP endpoint
  - server-side bundling
  - in-memory caching
  - file-system caching
  - file-system sources
