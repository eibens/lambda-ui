# Litdoc Server

The Litdoc server runs a web server that serves a Litdoc document. The server
can be started by calling the `serve` function with a Litdoc manifest.

```bash
deno run -A main.ts
```

:file/main.ts^:

```ts
import * as home from "./simple.ts";
import { serve } from "litdoc/serve.ts";

await serve({
  routes: {
    "/": home,
  },
  assets: {
    [import.meta.url]: home,
  },
});
```

:file/simple.ts^:

```ts
import { lit } from "litdoc/lit.ts";

export const doc = lit();
const { md } = doc;

md`
# Homepage
`;

await serve(doc);
```

# Self-contained server

Did you know, that a TypeScript module can import itself? This allows the
definition of a document to be self-contained.

:file/combined.ts^:

```ts
import { lit } from "litdoc/lit.ts";
import { serve } from "litdoc/serve.ts";
import * as home from "./combined.ts";

export const doc = lit({
  routes: {
    "/": home,
  },
  assets: {
    [import.meta.url]: home,
  },
});

const { md } = doc;

md`
# Homepage

Find us here: ${home}
`;

await serve(doc);
```

# URL parameter in manifests

In many cases it would be cumbersome or even limiting to use a full URL as the
file key in code. Users would either have to use the import.meta.url as base URL
or hardcode the exact path of the file on their system.

To solve this problem, Litdoc allows to use a base URL in the manifest. This URL
must be prepended to non-URL keys of the `assets` map.

# File path leaking (security issue)

Passing the server-side value of `import.meta.url` to clients is a security
risk. It allows an attacker to find out the exact path of the file on the
server. This can be used to find out the directory structure of the server and
to find other files that are not intended to be served. Therefore, **the
manifests must not contain absolute file URLs.**

Clients depend on the manifest to get the runtime values for the current page.
It stands to reason that assets should probably not at all be part of the
manifest, like they currently are. Rather, assets should be passed to the server
or collected by it and matched after routing.

The client in turn would receive the key for the applicable route and access the
module content in this way. There is no need to get to the module via the assets
map.

Litdoc can still allow the assets in the manifest and leave the security to the
user, perhaps supported by linter rules.

# Preventing file path leaking

This litdoc server is split into two litdocs.

:file/home.ts^:

```ts
import lit from "litdoc/lit.ts";
import * as home from "./home.ts";

export const doc = lit({
  routes: {
    "/": home,
  },
});

const { md } = doc;

md`
# Homepage
`;
```

:file/docs.ts^:

```ts
import lit from "litdoc/lit.ts";
import * as home from "./home.ts";
import * as docs from "./docs.ts";

export const doc = lit({
  assets: {
    "./home.ts": home,
  },
});

await serve(docs);
```

:file/client.ts^:

```ts
import { render } from "litdoc/render.ts";
import * as home from "./home.ts";

const root = document.getElementById("root");
render(home, root);
```

# Fresh integration

Fresh is a tiny, flexible web framework for Deno. It supports custom HTTP
endpoints and server-side rendering with interactive islands. It would provide a
robust basis for using Litdoc in production.
