# Litdoc Kernels

The Litdoc kernel defines the core generation pipeline of Litdoc. There are
different implementations of the kernel.

> :^icons/info: Each kernel implementation comes with its own set of
> dependencies. In order to minimize bundle sizes, the implementations are
> separated into different modules.

- server
  - Files read and written directly to the file system.
  - Reacts to file changes
    - Either by using file watcher,
    - or by polling file stats when the file is requested.
  - SWC WASM cached in file system.
  - HTTP server that can connect to a playground
- client
  - No access to file paths and cannot edit documents.
  - Hydrate with data loaded on the server (server-side rendering).
  - Uses indexDB for caching (for single page navigation).
  - Async fetching of missing pages and documents (retrieval or search).
  - Literate programming
    - Readonly, except for certain code blocks (of custom language).
    - Changes to code blocks are saved to local storage.
    - Files exist implicitly inside the documents as code blocks with file
      tokens.
- playground
  - Write, edit, and run litdoc modules in the browser.
  - Uses indexDB for caching.
  - Hydrate with data loaded on the server.
  - Allows user to edit files.
  - SWC cached in browser.
  - Use service worker for hosting the preview.
  - Git integration
    - Saving to local and remote git repository (using iso-git).
    - Cache files using iso-git file system.
    - In-browser build and preview.
  - Server integration
    - Syncing to file system of a server.
  - Editor (browser)
    - Visual editing of document content.
    - Syncs with a editor server.

# SWC Caching

The WASM module for SWC has over five megabytes. This is a lot of data to
transfer over the network. Additionally, decompression modules and bindings are
needed, which adds to any bundle that should use SWC.

# Outsourcing SWC

The SWC WASM module as well as the JavaScript bindings can be loaded from
`deno.land/x/swc`. The types can be loaded directly from
`esm.sh/@swc/core/types.d.ts`.

> Not sure if this is a good idea, as I don't know if `d.ts` files are supported
> by Fresh, and the WASM file should maybe be hosted by litdoc anyways.
